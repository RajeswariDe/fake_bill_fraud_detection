Fake Bill Detection using Deep Learning and OCR


This project detects fake or suspicious food bills submitted for employee reimbursement.

## 🔍 Features
- Image forgery detection using ResNet-18 (PyTorch)
- OCR-based text extraction (Tesseract)
- Pricing and timing anomaly detection
- Works even when image looks genuine but values are inflated

## 🧠 Approach
1. Real receipt images taken from Kaggle (Expenses Receipt OCR dataset)
2. Fake bills generated by tampering with amount/date regions
3. CNN trained to classify Genuine vs Fake bills
4. OCR used to extract restaurant name, total amount and time
5. Business rules applied to detect abnormal pricing/timing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV / Pillow
- Tesseract OCR
- Google Colab
